Feature: CLD200_EditGroup

**As a user, I would like to be able to modify my Watch Party Group so that I can add the link to the TeleParty link so that
others in the group can see it and join.**

This feature will allow the host of the watch party to make modifications to an already existing watch party group, it also
introduces a TeleParty URL field so that other users are able to join the watch party so that they can watch shows with
others in the group via the TeleParty thrid party extension.
